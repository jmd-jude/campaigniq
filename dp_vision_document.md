## Market Problem & Revenue Opportunity

### Current Economics Problem
- **Your Challenge:** Revenue tied to mail volume, not processing volume - when 1M records become 10K selections, revenue doesn't reflect the processing complexity
- **Agency Challenge:** Manual segmentation makes smaller clients unprofitable despite market demand
- **Market Gap:** Smaller clients want sophisticated targeting but can't justify traditional data science consulting costs

### The Unlocked Revenue Streams
- **Immediate:** Convert currently unprofitable small clients into profitable engagements
- **Scalable:** Offer this capability to multiple agencies beyond current relationships
- **Premium:** AI-powered analytics command higher fees than basic data processing
- **Recurring:** Every campaign becomes an analytics engagement, not just data processing
